While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because the term \"RCA\" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug fo",
